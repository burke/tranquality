# Tranquality

## What is it?

Tranquality is an in-progress effort to combine a bunch of existing
code-quality tools in a cohesive way. I don't have any specific goal in
mind; I'm just intending to see what happens as I clean up and merge the
codebases, and what comes out of the end result.

## Mostly-integrated

* Flog
* Flay

## TODO (maybe)

* Roodi
* Reek
* Churn (maybe -- this one's sort of out-of-band)
* Saikuro (maybe -- is this still relevant?)
